# Draw on a Napkin

[Live Demo](https://tuskerette.github.io/DrawOnFabric/)

Some people (mostly designers and artists, I guess) draw and take notes on paper napkins all the time.

This is just the front-end for now. No saving of napkins involved, yet.

This is an exercise using Fabric.js, for fun.
